### Javascript 2player Math Game

This project was an attempt to get familiar with Javascript after spending a weekend going through the Javascript track on Codecademy. The primary object was to create a two player game that asked a simple math question (addition, subtraction, multiplication) to each player alternating until one of the players had lost three lives.
